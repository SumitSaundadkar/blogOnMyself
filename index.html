                <h1>First step toward code?</h1>
                <p>I have started my first project and boom it is very easy for me doing this but when actual logic and coding comes everyone fear for doing that because logic is logic no one can get it in one night . Then i stop coding because everyone says about coding is that "dimag lagana padta bahut hard hai" and  yes it is natural beacuse having brain and not using our brain this is the main reason. One thing i have realise while coding "hardwork replace logic but it takes time." </p>
